### 🚀 Own features
### 🎯 Goal-Setting Capabilities (Inspired by YNAB)

The *goal-setting feature* in BudgetProApplication draws inspiration from industry-leading budgeting tools like *YNAB (You Need A Budget)* this was one of the apps we had to research in part 1. 
This functionality enables users to create *personalized financial goals* within their budget categories.

Key highlights:

* ✅ Users can *set monthly or one-time budget limits* per category.
* 🔁 The app tracks expenses in real-time and shows *how much is left* versus the goal.
* 🎯 This promotes *financial discipline* by encouraging conscious decision-making and accountability.
* 📆 Optionally, goals can be *carried over* into the next month to support long-term saving or spending plans.

This feature helps users *plan ahead, stay within limits, and **build better financial habits*.

### 📊 Visualized Reports with Charts and Graphs

To make financial insights more digestible, BudgetProApplication includes a *dynamic reporting dashboard* powered by *charts and graphs*. 
These visual tools transform raw expense data into meaningful insights at a glance.

Key highlights:

* 📅 View *monthly summaries* showing total spending by category or over time.
* 📈 *Bar and pie charts* are used to show how your money is distributed across categories.
* 📊 Users can quickly identify *which areas consume most of their budget*, helping them adjust goals and spending habits.
* 🎨 Visualizations update automatically as new data is entered, giving users a *real-time financial snapshot*.

This feature makes budgeting *more intuitive and engaging*, especially for visual learners or users new to financial management.
